        The objective is to establish an online platform where the valuable knowledge and practices of inspiring farmers are shared with the public and other farmers. The website will be the main structure and mechanism for the functioning of Beacon Farms. The site is aimed at two distinct user groups; for farmers to be inspired, learn and connect with each other to exchange knowledge, expertise and ideas in support of their sustainability journey, and for the public to become directly engaged and better informed with how and where healthy, sustainable food is produced. Each Beacon Farm will have a proAile on the website displaying information and media, such as a video and photos, which gives detailed insight into the farm according to a standardised template.

          Users will have the opportunity to browse a curated list of farms, or browse farms on a map, depending on whether they seek inspiration, speciAic knowledge, or wish to directly connect with a farm via a written message or in person via a farm visit. Users can learn more via speciAic content on key sustainable farming practices as well as the opportunity to enter into group discussion around a question or topic of interest.
